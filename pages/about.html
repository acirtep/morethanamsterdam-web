        <p>This is a web application that helps you plan day trips across the Netherlands using the Dutch railway network.
          Instead of just visiting Amsterdam, explore the diverse provinces and cities that the Netherlands has to offer.</p>

        <p>With its extensive railway network, the Netherlands is the perfect country to schedule multi-leg day trips.
        Not only that train services are frequent and cover almost each corner of the country, but it is environmental friendly and a great way to travel sustainably.
        </p>

        <p>In this trip planner, you can plan a day trip with layover in multiple cities in the Netherlands and select which cities to include or skip in your day trip. You can also start and end in the same train station!</p>
