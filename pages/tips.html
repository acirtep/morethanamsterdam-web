        <h3>Food</h3>
        <p>
          The Dutch cuisine is not known for its diversity, but there are few
          things to try out:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Sandwiches</b>: You can find good sandwiches at any
              supermarket, but the best ones are sold by places with the word
              "broodje" in their name. The sandwiches are prepared in front of
              you and, usually, the options are diverse (gluten free might be
              hard to find, though).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <b>Fish</b>: At any market and some other reserved spots in the
              cities, you will find a fish truck. Usually named "Vishandel" or
              "Visspecialist", they will have plenty of fish options. The most
              known are "kibbeling" (battered fish) and raw hering. The best
              ones are along the North Sea coast.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
