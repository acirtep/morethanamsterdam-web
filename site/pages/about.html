          <h3>What does the app do</h3>
          <p>
            This is a web application that helps you plan multi-leg day trips
            across the Netherlands using the Dutch railway network, in the
            hop-on, hop-off manner. Instead of just visiting Amsterdam, explore
            the diverse provinces and cities that the Netherlands has to offer.
          </p>

          <p>
            With its extensive railway network, the Netherlands is the perfect
            country to schedule multi-leg day trips. Not only that train
            services are frequent and cover almost each corner of the country,
            but it is environmental friendly and a great way to travel
            sustainably.
          </p>

          <p>
            In this trip planner, you can plan a day trip with layover in
            multiple cities in the Netherlands and select which cities to
            include or skip in your day trip. You can also start and end in the
            same train station!

          <h3>What does the app not do</h3>
          <p>
            The application does not plan trips in real-time and does not take
            into account possible delays or cancellations. It is based on
            historical data, therefore it does not provide exact time departures
            or arrivals. For such information, always check the NS journey
            planner.
          </p>
          <p>
            The application will not suggest the same city twice as a place to
            visit and explore. However, trains can still pass through cities you
            have already planned to visit. This is important because many Dutch
            cities serve as major train hubs, and blocking them completely would
            return often no suggestions. For example, in the above suggestions,
            traveling from Utrecht to Hoorn will pass through Amsterdam, even if
            it was the starting point of the journey.
